# Blog Post Project

This is a simple blog application built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Chakra UI. The application displays a list of blog posts on the homepage and allows users to view individual posts on a separate page.

## Technologies Used
- Next.js
- TypeScript
- Chakra UI

## Features
- Blog Home Page: Displays a list of blog posts with titles, dates, and excerpts.
- Blog Post Page: Shows the full content of a selected blog post with a back button.
- Responsive Design: The application is responsive and works well on various screen sizes.
## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
